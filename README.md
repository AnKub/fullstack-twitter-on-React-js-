Project Overview: Simplified Twitter-like Application
The goal of this project was to create a simplified version of Twitter, focusing on core functionalities such as user authentication, posting messages, and viewing posts from others. The project consists of two parts: Frontend and Backend.

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend - React Application
The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface. It allows users to create and view posts, similar to Twitter.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility with various screen sizes.
User Interaction: Users can post and view messages.
Reusable Components: Built with React components for easier maintenance.
State Management: React hooks for dynamic data handling.
Testing: Using Jest and React Testing Library for testing components.
Technologies:
React: Frontend framework
React Router: Navigation between components
Jest: Testing framework
Web Vitals: Performance monitoring

test: Runs Jest tests.
eject: Ejects from the create-react-app setup.
üíª Backend - Express Application with Handlebars and Sass
The backend uses Node.js with Express, handling routes and user authentication. It also uses Handlebars for templating and Sass for styling.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Basic login functionality with cookie parsing.
Routing: Handled by Express to navigate between pages.
Dynamic Templating: Handlebars for rendering HTML content.
Real-time Updates: LiveReload for automatic updates.
Styling: Sass for modular and maintainable CSS.
Technologies:
Node.js: Backend JavaScript runtime
Express: Web framework for routing and logic
Handlebars: Templating engine for dynamic HTML
Sass: CSS preprocessor for better styles
